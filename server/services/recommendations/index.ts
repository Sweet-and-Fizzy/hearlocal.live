/**
 * Recommendation Scoring Service
 *
 * Scores events against a user's taste profile to generate personalized recommendations.
 *
 * ## Algorithm Overview
 *
 * Events are scored using a weighted combination of signals:
 *
 * ### Primary Signals (user's explicit preferences)
 *
 * - **Artist Match (25%)**: Events featuring the user's favorite artists get
 *   the strongest signal. This is the most direct indicator of interest.
 *
 * - **Embedding Similarity (25%)**: Cosine similarity between user's taste profile
 *   embedding and event embedding. The taste profile is built from:
 *   - Favorite artists (50% weight) - averaged artist profile embeddings
 *   - Favorite genres + event types (30% weight) - converted to descriptive text
 *   - Interest description (20% weight) - free-form text
 *   This captures semantic similarity - e.g., if you like funk, you'll match
 *   events with similar vibes even if genres don't exactly match.
 *
 * - **Genre Overlap (18%)**: Direct match between event's canonical genres and
 *   user's favorite genres. 2+ matches = full score. This is explicit matching,
 *   separate from the embedding similarity.
 *
 * - **Event Type Match (12%)**: Events matching favorite event types (Music, DJ,
 *   Comedy, Open Mic, etc.) get a boost.
 *
 * - **Venue Match (10%)**: Events at user's favorite venues score higher.
 *
 * ### Secondary Signals (inferred from behavior)
 *
 * - **Attendance Genre Overlap (5%)**: Events with genres similar to events the
 *   user is attending/interested in.
 * - **Attendance Venue Match (3%)**: Events at venues where user is attending
 *   other events.
 * - **Attendance Event Type Match (2%)**: Same event type as events user is
 *   attending.
 *
 * ## Why Both Embedding AND Explicit Matching?
 *
 * The embedding captures "vibe" - semantic similarity that goes beyond exact genre
 * labels. An event might not be tagged as "funk" but could have a funky feel that
 * matches your taste profile. The explicit genre/venue/type matching ensures we
 * don't miss obvious matches and gives users predictable results based on their
 * stated preferences.
 *
 * ## Scoring Process
 *
 * 1. **Candidate Selection**: All events in the date range with embeddings are
 *    fetched (no early limiting to avoid missing good matches later in the range).
 *
 * 2. **Scoring**: Each event is scored against the user profile. The final score
 *    is a weighted average of all signal scores.
 *
 * 3. **Confidence**: Calculated from number of matching signals + overall score.
 *    Events below the confidence threshold (0.4 for chat, 0.6 default) are filtered.
 *
 * 4. **Ranking**: Events are sorted by score and top N returned.
 *
 * ## Reason Display
 *
 * Each recommendation includes human-readable reasons explaining why it was
 * recommended. Reasons are sorted by their weight so the most impactful reason
 * appears first (e.g., "funk music · At Stone Church, a favorite venue").
